How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Maybe, since we could spot each line's difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Sure, if a bug happens, we can revert it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: a more controlled saving means save only when you are going to
    Cons: It takes a manual effort to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows saving all files at once

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff commit1 commit2
    git log

    diff helps me to ciscern the differences on each edited files
    log helps me look at the changelogs

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is easy to revert

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    anything.
